IMPORTANT
This package requires NPSOL be installed. In addition to DSMH simulation, it also contains the code that does optimization after DSMH simulation. 

In the file src/dsmh_mpi/DispatchTuneSimulation.cpp, Line 107, there is a flag NPSOL_HIGHEST_PLUS_1 by defulat set as false. This means that at the initial stage, the simulator draws samples from the prior distribution, and the constant of integration for the ininital stage is 1. 

If the flag NPSOL_HIGHEST_PLUS_1 is set as true, then at the initial stage, the simulator first finds a maximum point of the heated posterior distribution (by applying the NPSOL method), and then runs adaptive Metropolis-Hasting method to get draws. In this way, the constant of integration at the initial stage may not necessarily be 1, and therefore the constant of integrations for the remaining stages may not be accurate. 

Also included in this package are the codes to do the optimization after the DSMH simulation. Two examples are also included for sbvar and tvsbvar models, src/time_series/test_sbvar_optimization.cpp and src/time_series/test_tvsbvar_optimization.cpp.

1. Libraries that are needed before dsmh can be properly installed
a. GSL (GNU Scientific Library), http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/
b. BLAS (Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms), http://www.netlib.org/blas/
c. LAPACK (Linear Algebra PACKage), http://www.netlib.org/lapack/
d. MPICH, https://www.mpich.org/
e. NPSOL 

2. Installation
a. Run 'configure LDFLAGS="-Lpath-of-npsol-library-files -lnpsol_f77 -llssol_f77' [--prefix directory-where-dsmh-package-will-be-installed]'
b. Run 'make install' and the 'bin' and 'share' directories will be generated in the directory where the dsmh package is installed. The 'bin' directory contains the executable codes of the examples. And the 'share' directory contains the data that the examples will use. 
c. Run 'make clean' for clean-up.

3. When dsmh cannot be successfully installed, check whether the required libraries have been properly installed.
a1. GSL header files
The header files of the gsl package should by default be installed in /usr/local/include/gsl/ or /usr/include/gsl/. If not, then the directory of the header files should be specified when running 'configure' (2a, in addition to the other flags), as follows:

configure CXXFLAGS=-I[directory-of-gsl-header-files] 

a2. GSL library files
The GSL library files, libm.so (or libm.a), libgslcblas.so (or libgslcblas.a), and libgsl.so (libgsl.a), should by default be installed in /usr/local/lib/ or /usr/lib64/ or /usr/lib/. If not, then the directory of the library files should be specified when running 'configure' (2a, in addition to the other flags), as follows:

configure LDFLAGS=-L[directory-of-gsl-library-files]

b. BLAS 
The BLAS library file, libblas.so (or libblas.a), should by default be installed in /usr/lib64/ or /usr/lib/ or /usr/local/lib/. If not, then the directory of this library file should be specified when running 'configure' (2a, in addition to the other flags), as follows:

configure LDFLAGS=-L[directory-of-blas-library-file]

c. LAPACK
The LAPACK library file, liblapack.so (or liblapack.a), should by default be installed in /usr/lib64 or /usr/lib/ or /usr/local/lib/. If not, then the directory of this library file should be specified when running 'configure' (2a, in addition to the other flags), as follows:

configure LDFLAGS=-L[directory-of-blas-library-file]

d. MPICH
The MPICH library file, libmpi.so (or libmpi.a), should by default be installed in /usr/local/lib or /usr/lib64/ or /usr/lib/. If not, then the directory of this library file should be specified when running 'configure' (2a, in addition to the other flags), as follows:

configure LDFLAGS=-L[directory-of-mpi-library-file]

e. In the above (a1-d), if mutiple paths need to be specified with either CXXFLAGS or LDFLAGS, then single quotes should be used to enclose all the paths, as follows:

CXXFLAGS='-I[path1] -I[path2] ...'
LDFLAGS='-L[path1] -L[path2] ...'

4. For new models, revise src/Makefile.am accordingly.
